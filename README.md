# NEA-JS
## JavaScript rewrite of my NEA code up til now

## TODO:
### 1 - Improve graphing by adding scale options and adding colours and axis details
  have to use a global mouse position sadge :((((((((
### 2 - add input for which object to track for the graphs using html + css.
### 3 - fix bug where graph pointer is stuck in the middle of the graph after simulation is refreshed.
### 4 - fix mouse click causing problems - likely recode the force input methods.
