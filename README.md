# NEA-JS
## JavaScript rewrite of my NEA code up til now

## TODO:
### 1 - add input for which object to track for the graphs.
### 2 - fix mouse click causing problems - likely recode the force input methods.
### 3 - add number scales on the side of the graphs.
### 4 - change up to be positive and down to be negative on graphs (maybe add for user to choose, probably useless).
### 5 - add the rest of the presets
### 6 - refactor code for modules to be self-contained, i.e. move all UI drawing into the main.js
### 7 - make a canvasPlotter object to draw all of the canvas related features.
### 8 - test if collisions actually follow the law of conservation of momentum in simple situations.
### 9 - add scaling as to what one pixel is in meters (make it accurate to the graph/one-to-one)
### 10 - write design phase for the NEA.
